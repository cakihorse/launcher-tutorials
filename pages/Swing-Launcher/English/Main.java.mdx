# Main.java

The class extends JFrame, so we can directly use the Main() function to set the window.
We set :
- The title of the window
- its size
- The result as a click on the quit button
- The content of the window
- its icon
- And if it's resizable.

  The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is not yours. Please make your GUI !

## isConnected ?
```java
MicrosoftAuthenticator microsoftAuthenticator = new MicrosoftAuthenticator();
        final String refresh_token = getSaver().get("refresh_token");
        MicrosoftAuthResult result;

        if (refresh_token != null) {
            try {
                result = microsoftAuthenticator.loginWithRefreshToken(refresh_token);
            } catch (MicrosoftAuthenticationException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException(ex);
            }
            Launcher.authInfos = new AuthInfos(result.getProfile().getName(), result.getAccessToken(), result.getProfile().getId());
            System.out.printf("Logged in with '%s'%n", result.getProfile().getName());
            setContentPane(new PHome());
            repaint();
            revalidate();
        }
        ```
        
This bit of code verify if a microsoft account (refresh_token, **not the credentials**) is saved in the saver file. If it's true, the launcher will launch correctly, if it's false a webView will appear.

## A bit of fun
I've add a little function to allow users to move the window wind their mouse.
You're don't have to keep this function.
#### Theme ?
I also applyed a theme (intellij theme), this is also not a necessary.

## Launching the window
```java
Main main = new Main();
```
It's only there to launch the window.
